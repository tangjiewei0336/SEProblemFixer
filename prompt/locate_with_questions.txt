I will give you a Spring Boot project code repo.
Your task is to try to complement "{{commit_type}} {{commit_msg}}" in the code repo.
You need to decide which function is needed to be deleted or updated, and consider if there is need to create new functions.
You may come across doubts when analysing the code, you must ask me at least one questions to solve your doubts.

After all your doubts are solved, you should reply with the json format below.
Strictly answer in following json format. Do not add any words. Do not add any comments. Do not make up parts. Do not prepend or append any words to the json.
[
    {
        "file": "the_file_name",
        "function": "the_function_name",
        "operation": "delete" or "create" or "update",
    },
    {
        ( the second or more file with same format as above if needed )
    }
]
Do not explain the reason. Do not make up your answer. Don't miss anything because of newlines and whitespaces.

Here are the codes.
{{code_repo}}

Now you must ask me at least one question to solve your doubts when analysing the code, after I solve all your doubts, you must reply in the json format defined at the beginning.
