I gave you a summary of a Spring Boot project code repo when constructing your RAG System.
Your task is to try to complement "{{commit_type}} {{commit_msg}}" in the code repo.
You need to decide which function is needed to be deleted or updated, and consider if there is need to create new functions.

Strictly answer in following json format. Do not add any words. Do not add any comments. Do not make up parts. Do not prepend or append any words to the json.
[
    {{
        "file": "the_file_name",
        "function": "the_function_name",
        "operation": "delete" or "create" or "update",
    }},
    {{
        ( the second or more file with same format as above if needed )
    }}
]
Do not explain the reason. Do not make up your answer. Don't miss anything because of newlines and whitespaces.
